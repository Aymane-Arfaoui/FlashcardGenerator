      "question": "Compare experience-based estimation with parametric-based estimation. What distinguishes these methods?",
      "answer": "•\t**Experience-based estimation** relies on historical data, expert judgment, and analogies from similar projects. It is often quick and based on subjective assessments.  •\t**Parametric-based estimation** uses mathematical models that relate project parameters (e.g., size measured in lines of code or function points) to effort or cost. An example is the CoCoMo model."

      "question": "What is the basic CoCoMo model and its formula for effort estimation?",
      "answer": "EFFORT = c × (SIZE)^k  where c and k are constants that depend on the project classification (organic, semi-detached, or embedded)."

      "question": "What are “scale factors” and “effort multipliers” in the CoCoMo II model, and how do they affect the effort estimate?",
      "answer": "•\t**Scale Factors (sf):** These factors reflect the exponential impact of project size on effort. They account for aspects like precedentedness, development flexibility, risk resolution, team cohesion, and process maturity. The overall scale factor is computed as:  sf = B + 0.01 × (sum of exponent driver ratings)  where B is a base constant (e.g., 0.91).  •\t**Effort Multipliers (em):** These adjust the nominal effort estimate based on cost drivers (e.g., required reliability, complexity, team capability). A multiplier greater than 1 increases the estimate, while one less than 1 decreases it.  In CoCoMo II, the effort is estimated using:  p-m = A × (SIZE)^sf × (em₁ × em₂ × … × emₙ)  where A is a constant, SIZE is measured in kdsi, and em values are the effort multipliers."

      "question": "What is the “Cone of Uncertainty” in software estimation, and why is it significant?",
      "answer": "The Cone of Uncertainty illustrates that at the start of a project, uncertainty is high and estimates are less reliable. As the project progresses and more information becomes available, uncertainty narrows, leading to more accurate estimates. This concept underscores the importance of re-estimation and continual planning as the project advances."

      "question": "How can over-estimation and under-estimation affect a software project? Provide related principles.",
      "answer": "•\t**Over-Estimation:** May lead to Parkinson’s Law (“work expands to fill the time available”), causing a project to drag on longer than necessary.  •\t**Under-Estimation:** Can invoke Murphy’s Law (“anything that can go wrong will go wrong”), resulting in rushed work, compromised quality, and missed deadlines. Brooks’ Law also warns that adding more people to a late project can further delay it.  These principles highlight the importance of accurate estimation."

      "question": "Why might organizations choose Function Points over lines of code (LOC) for sizing a project?",
      "answer": "Function Points measure the functionality offered by a system, making them language- and developer-independent. Unlike LOC, which can only be determined after implementation, Function Points can be calculated early in the project lifecycle, enabling better prediction of cost and effort."

      "answer": "The COSMIC Function Point method is a functional size measurement (FSM) approach that quantifies the functionality of a software system based solely on the Functional User Requirements (FURs). It conforms to the ISO meta-standard (ISO 19761) and focuses on measuring data movements (entries, exits, reads, and writes) within functional processes. COSMIC is used because it provides an early and language-independent sizing method that can be applied before the system is implemented."

      "answer": "•\t**Entry (E):** Moves a data group into a functional process from a functional user (triggering event).  •\t**Exit (X):** Moves a data group out of a functional process to a functional user (provides output).  •\t**Write (W):** Moves a data group from a functional process to persistent storage.  •\t**Read (R):** Moves a data group from persistent storage to a functional process."

    {
      "id": 78,
      "question": "What constitutes a functional process in the context of COSMIC, and why is it important?",
      "answer": "A functional process in COSMIC is an independently executable set of operations that responds to a triggering event. It is important because it defines the boundary within which data movements are measured. The functional process encapsulates all necessary steps (entries, exits, reads, and writes) to satisfy a functional requirement, allowing for a structured measurement of system functionality."

      "answer": "The COSMIC FSM exercise is designed to provide hands-on experience in measuring the functional size of a system based on a specific use case (e.g., “Create a new customer”). It guides students through identifying functional processes, data movements, and calculating the total COSMIC Function Points (CFPs) for that functionality. In one exercise, the total functional size was determined to be 6 CFPs, illustrating the process in a practical context."
