It helps ensure that resources are used efficiently, deadlines are met, and risks are managed, all of which are critical to delivering a project on time and within budget.\n\n**Q6: What is the difference between directing and controlling in project management?**\n\n**A6:**\n\n•\t**Directing** involves leading and motivating the team, making decisions, delegating tasks, and ensuring smooth day-to-day operations.\n\n•\t**Controlling** is about monitoring progress, measuring performance against the established plan, and taking corrective actions to address deviations.\n\n**Q7: According to the lecture, why is the role of a project manager critical in software projects?**\n\n**A7:** The project manager is critical because they coordinate the planning, organizing, staffing, directing, and controlling of project activities to ensure that the project meets its objectives on time, within budget, and according to specified requirements. They serve as the central point for communication, decision-making, and risk management.\n\n**Q8: What are some typical challenges in managing software projects as outlined in Lecture 1?**\n\n**A8:** Typical challenges include dealing with project complexity, managing changing requirements, coordinating diverse teams, balancing limited resources, and ensuring clear communication among all stakeholders.\n\n**Q9: How does the definition of management in Lecture 1 differ from the everyday use of the term?**\n\n**A9:** In the context of software project management, management is defined as a systematic process of planning, organizing, directing, and controlling efforts to achieve specific objectives efficiently. This formal definition emphasizes structured methods and techniques, whereas everyday use of the term might be more informal and less structured.\n\n**Q10: What inspirational quotes were highlighted in Lecture 1, and what lessons do they convey for project managers?**\n\n**A10:**\n\n•\tLewis Carroll: \"If you don't know where you are going, any road will get you there.\" This quote stresses the importance of having a clear vision and direction.\n\n•\tPeter F. Drucker: \"Management is doing things right; leadership is doing the right things.\" This highlights the difference between efficiency in execution and effectiveness in decision-making.\n\nLECTURE 2 CONCEPTS:\n\n**Q1: What are the main objectives of Lecture 2?**\n\n**A1:** The objectives are to identify key elements of Software Project Management and to outline a workflow model for managing software projects. This lecture also explains the essence of managing and leading software projects.\n\n**Q2: What are some reasons managing and leading software projects is difficult?**\n\n**A2:** Difficulties arise due to factors such as software complexity, conformity, changeability, invisibility, and the team-oriented, intellect-intensive nature of the work. These challenges make planning and execution more complicated than in many other fields.\n`;","map":{"version":3,"names":["flashcardsData"],"sources":["/Users/aymanearfaoui/Desktop/Concordia2024-2025/winter2025/SOEN 384/lectures/flashCards/flascard-app/src/flashcardsData.js"],"sourcesContent":["export const flashcardsData = `\n# Studying for 384\n\nLECTURE 1 CONCEPTS: \n\n**Q2: How is a project defined in the context of software project management?**\n\n**A2:** A project is defined as a set of interrelated tasks with a specific goal, having defined start and end dates, funding limits, and resource consumption, ultimately aiming to produce a unique product, service, or result.\n\n**Q3: What are the five key management functions described in Lecture 1, and what does each function entail ?**\n\n**A3:**\n\n**Planning:** Establishing goals, developing strategies, forecasting, budgeting, and documenting project plans.\n\n**Organizing:** Grouping tasks, establishing structures, assigning roles and responsibilities, and creating an organizational hierarchy.\n\n**Staffing:** Recruiting, training, evaluating, compensating, and sometimes replacing personnel to ensure the right people are in place.\n\n**Directing:** Leading and supervising team members, motivating personnel, delegating authority, coordinating activities, and resolving conflicts.\n\n**Controlling:** Monitoring progress, measuring performance against the plan, initiating corrective actions, and ensuring the project stays on track.\n\n**Q4: Describe the \"four P's\" a project manager must focus on.**\n\n**A4:** The four P's are:\n\n**People:** The team members and stakeholders involved.\n\n**Product:** The final deliverables or outcomes of the project.\n\n**Process:** The methods, procedures, and tools used to execute the project.\n\n**Project:** The overall structure, scope, and objectives of the endeavour.\n\n**Q5: In your own words, explain why effective planning is crucial for the success of a software project.**\n\n**A5:** Effective planning sets a clear direction for the project by establishing goals, defining the necessary actions, and preparing for potential obstacles.
